# Customer Segmentation Project

This project demonstrates how I used machine learning for customer clustering. 
All relevant data processing, analysis, and results are contained within the notebook/code file.

## Project Description
- Applied KMeans (with k determined by the Knee method) and DBSCAN for customer clustering.
- Evaluated cluster quality using Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Index.
- Performed PCA to reduce dimensionality while retaining 95% of the variance, and conducted all clustering analyses on the PCA-transformed data.
- Visualized clusters using t-SNE for a clear representation of local structures.
- Highlighted potential customer subgroups for actionable business insights.

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook/code file to see the full workflow.
2. Run the code cells to reproduce the analysis.
3. All explanations, metrics, and interpretations are embedded within the file.

## Notes
- No external dataset is included; all data and preprocessing steps are inside the project file.
- .gitignore is used to exclude temporary files and unnecessary artifacts.
